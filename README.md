1. No. This is because messaging seems to involve a lot of components like linking one user with another, the sending of the texts themselves, and a whole database of things to save in the chat. Because of this, testing it in a unit test seems to be hard or even impossible.
2. Yes. Max message length seems to be pretty simple and really only need one component for its functionality: just inputting a text with more than 80 characters in it to the messaging and expect an error. Because it is easy, it'd be a good practice to do it in the unit test for extra consistency in testing and ease.
